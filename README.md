### README for Juniper Worrall's Assignment 1
Start by opening a terminal and running the command "java -jar Server-jar-with-dependencies.jar", this will initiate the jar file that will run the server.
On a seperate terminal, run the command "java -jar Client-jar-with-dependencies.jar", this does the same but for a client.

The available commands should be shown when run but all possible ones are:
* push x
* pop
* delayPop x
* isEmpty
* pushOperation min
* pushOperation max
* pushOperation lcm
* pushOperation gcd
* quit
where x is a positive integer.
